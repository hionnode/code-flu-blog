Beginners are often drawn to writing code right away when given a problem to solve. They might not fully understand the problem or if their code is correct, but the appeal of seeing code fill the screen is too tempting.

In this guide, we'll navigate through the process of designing and implementing a Typescript function systematically.



## Step 1: Define the Function Signature, Purpose, and Stub

### Function Signature:
The signature represents the type of each argument followed by  ->  and the type of the result. For example, a function that takes a number and returns a number would have a signature like Number  ->  Number.

### Purpose Statement:
A one-line statement describing what the function does.

### Function Stub:
A syntactically complete function definition that produces a value of the correct type.

Here's an example:

```typescript
/**
 * Function Signature: Number -> Number
 * Purpose: Produces n times 2
 * Stub: Returns 0 for any input
 * 
 * @param {number} n - The input number
 * @returns {number} - The result of n times 2
 */
function double(n:number):number {
    return 0; // Stub
}
```

## Step 2: Define Examples 

### Examples:
Examples help us understand the function behavior and serve as test cases. Each example includes a call to the function and the expected result.

```javascript
console.log(double(0)); // Expected: 0
console.log(double(1)); // Expected: 2
console.log(double(3)); // Expected: 6
```


## Step 3: Code the Function Body

### Function Body:
Complete the function body by filling in the template using information from the purpose statement, examples, and template.

```javascript
function double(n:number):number {
    return n*2; // Function Body
}
```
## Step 4: Test and Debug Until Correct

### Testing:
Run the function with the provided examples and ensure that it produces the expected results. Debug any issues that arise.

```javascript
console.log(double(0)); // Expected: 0

console.log(double(1)); // Expected: 2

console.log(double(3)); // Expected: 6

```
By following this systematic approach, you can design and implement Typescript functions effectively, ensuring correctness and clarity in your code. Remember to iterate through the steps, testing and debugging as you go, to create robust and reliable functions.
